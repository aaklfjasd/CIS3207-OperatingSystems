I created a makefile to make it easier to compile everything
TO RUN PROGRAM TYPE
make
./lab4

I created a simple tester program and used the 2MB drive provided to us to test.The tester just uses all of the functions required from the lab: open,close,create,delete,read, and write to check if my version of the functions work or not.
